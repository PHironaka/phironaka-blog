It's been a fun and rewarding experience to build my first web app. In the spirit of always learning and getting better, I've listed out some of the top takeaways I take away from the process:</p>\n<h2>When in doubt, commit your code</h2>\n<p>This was a bigger issue at the start of the project for me. I'd be in the middle of writing some code and without saving it, I would revert back to what I had previously written. The beauty of using git is that you can always revert back to a previous commit. Don't be afraid to commit, is the moral of the story.</p>\n<h2>The user comes first</h2>\n<p>I know, this all sounds incredibly redundant,  you'll have to bear with me. As I started to add in more features, it started becoming apparent that I was over-cluttering the app to the point where it became difficult to find the essential elements I wanted the user to use. Part of figuring out what my MVP was stripping away any of the excess fat, or unnecessary features that weren't as relevant.</p>\n<p>I'm still in the process of pushing a few final updates to achieve my MVP, but by all accounts this is how I envisioned the finished product to look like. I hope it serves my fellow producers well in the field!</p>",frontmatter:{title:"New project alert! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/new-project-001/"}}}});
